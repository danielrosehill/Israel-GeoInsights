# Stratifying countries 

P002

## Prompt text

Let's say that we wanted to categorise the nature of the relationships between the State of Israel and world countries.

The objective would be to group the countries of the world into groups which reflect bilateral relations that are broadly similar in nature.

There are many approaches we could use to reach such a categorisation.

Suggest 5 approaches we might use.

For each:

- Give the approach a name  
- Describe why such a categorisation might be useful  
- Provide a few example categories
- For each example category, provide a couple of countries followed by their ISO-3166 Alpha 2 identifier
