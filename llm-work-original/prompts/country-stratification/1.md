### V1

The State of Israel enjoys diplomatic relations with countries around the world.

Let's say that we wanted to divide its relations with those countries into categories - the categories would group countries which have broadly similar bilateral relations with Israel.

We might have:

- A category like "Generally friendly" that includes countries like the USA.
- "Especially hostile European countries" that includes countries like Ireland and Spain.
- A group for countries which do not recognise Israel.

The examples are only to provide guidance. Do not view them as instructive. Create your own categories however you think is most logical.

Generate a list of 10 categories, each representing a cluster of similar bilateral ties. For each category, provide 3 countries which are representative examples of the countries in that group. Provide each of those countries with both its name and its Alpha-2 identifier in ISO 3166.
